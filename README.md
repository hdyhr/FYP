#How to push changes?
- commit all changes to your own branch
- fetch origin?
- create a pull request

#USING GITHUB 
create a new branch from origin/master
'branch-name' --> 'origin/master'
do a git pull origin master before committing changes.
resolve conflict if any
compare the codes to check if its the intended chages
add commit comment --> stage file --> commit staged --> push
go to github --> refresh --> do a compare and pull request --> write comments --> assign to someone --> create pull request
